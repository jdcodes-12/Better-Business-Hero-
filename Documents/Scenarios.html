            <!-- Scenario #1 - Employee Clocking In & Out -->
            <h3><strong>Scenario #1 - Employee Clocking In & Out For A Shift</strong></h3>
            <p>
                All employees are assigned a unique username, password, and Employee Identification Number upon hire (EIN). 
                Before an employee can start a shift, she must first clock in. To clock in, she must utilize the BBH system.
                Upon first seeing the BBH system, she is presented with a login screen that prompts for her EIN. After succesfully logging in,
                the "Main" screen appears with general options. The employee navigates to the "Employee" section of the system via
                using the "Employee" button found on the main screen.
                <br>
                <br>
                Once on the Employee screen appears, she must click the "Clock In" button. This prompts her to enter her EIN again.
                After entering the EIN, she is clocked into the system for the day. A timestamp is made to note the starting time of the shift (e.g. "time in").
                Clocking out is a similar process. The employee must navigate back to the Employee screen, then hit the "Clock out" button.
                This prompts her for her EIN, she is now clocked out of the system for the day. A timestamp is made to note the ending time of the shift (e.g. "time out");
                <br>
                <br>
                After a succesful clock in and out for a shift, the timestamps are compared to determine hours worked. 
                Hours worked are then updated on the employee's user profile.

        <!-- Scenario #2 - Manager Logging Inventory for the Month -->
        <div class="scenario-two">
        <h3><strong>Scenario #2 - Manager Logging Inventory for the Month</strong></h3>
            <p>
              A manager is given a task from the owner to start next month's inventory tracking sheet.
              To do this, she must succesfully login to the BBH system then navigate to the "Inventory Management" screen via the Inventory Mgmnt. button
              on the main screen.
              <br>
              <br>
              On the Inventory Management screen, she is given options - Create, Read, Update, Delete - to interact with an active inventory sheet.
              She starts the process by clicking the "Create Sheet" button from the list pane, then is prompted to enter a name. Once the name is entered, a new active sheet
              is created with the provided name. She can then begin entering or simply leave the sheet blank. 
              <br>
              <br>
              When she needs to update the inventory sheet, she can use the "Read" option to search for the previously created sheet.
              If the sheet is found, it is displayed in the active window. She then can use the "Update" option to start editing the active inventory sheet.

              <br>
              <br>
              The files will be saved automatically before closing an active inventory sheet or switching between sheets.

        <!-- Scenario #3 - Owner Logging Liabilities for the Month -->
        <div class="scenario-three">
            <h3><strong>Scenario #3 - Owner Logging Liabilities & Assets for the Month</strong></h3>
                <p>
                An owner is asked by the financial department to make sure all liabilites and assets for a month are verified and reported correctly.
                To do this, the owner must first succesfully log into the BBH system, then navigate to the "Financial Reporting" screen via the Reporting button on the main screen.
                <br>
                <br>
                On the Financial Reporting screen, the owner is presented with two categories of interaction options - Assets and Liabilities. Since she is asked to verify both, she starts with Assets.
                She navigates to the "Asset Collection" section via clicking the Asset button on the Financial Reporting screen.
                <br>
                <br>
                Once on the Asset Section, she then chooses "Read" from the interaction options on the list. This prompts her to enter a filename to look for. 
                She enters the current month, then that file, if it exists, is brought to the active window. She becomes to review each entry, verifying that the fields are correctly reported.
                <br>
                <br>
                If changes needs to be made, she can click the "Update" option from the list. This will allow her to edit the active sheet, changing any fields that are necessary.
